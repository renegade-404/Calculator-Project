# Calculator-Project

First, big project.

Finished after 4 days. It was hell of a ride, but the experience I've gained is priceless.
I'm so grateful to people from TOP who worked so hard and came up with all of these ideas for projects, so WE can try our best and stand to the challenges by completing them and grow.

There is still space for improvement - I know. However, I decided to come back here after I've learned more. The calculator in the current form works properly. I'm excited to add new features in the future. 

[Me from the future - remember to add notation and date!]

Thank you. I won't leave this rollercoaster until the ride is finished.
(and it won't be ever finished I hope)
